## About The Project

![alt text](https://github.com/stente3/Fetch-api-countries/blob/main/source/designs/main.png)

Welcome to my project! This website allows you to explore different countries around the world. Using an API, you can easily access information about each country, including their population, capital city, and official language.

To help narrow down your search, you can filter countries by continent. Additionally, a search bar is available to easily find a specific country.
Once you find a country of interest, you can view detailed information about it, such as its history, culture, and geography.

This website is also responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless user experience. Start exploring the world today!

## Getting Started
This is the structure of the folders.

The-project/ <br>
├──index.html <br>
├── public/ <br>
│....├──assets/ <br>
│.........└──img/ <br>
│....├──css/ <br>
│....└──js/ <br>
└── source/ <br>
......├──designs/ <br>
......├──js/ <br>
.........└──view/ <br>
......├──img/ <br>
......└──sass/ <br>
...........├──base/ <br>
...........├──layout/ <br>
...........└──app.scss <br>

The sass files that are inside the "base" folder are the general configuration of the project and the files that are inside the "layout" folder are the ones that directly affect the client-side layout.

### Prerequisites

* You need a web browser to view the content, it is recommended NOT to use Internet Explorer
* A code editor to modify the content
* Git to clone the repository
* The "Live Sass Compiler" visual studio code extension or any other Sass compiler

### Installation
1. Clone the repository in the terminal 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/stente3/Fetch-api-countries.git
   ```

## Usage
The only thing you need to start modifying the project is to have a Sass compiler and the modified Css file must be sent to the app.css file found in the following location <br>
The-project / <br>
├── public / <br>
│....└──css / <br>

And a code editor to be able to modify any other file
